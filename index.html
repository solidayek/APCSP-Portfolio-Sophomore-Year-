    <h1 style= "text-align:center; color:pink"> About Me 😉  </h1>
    <p>Welcome there, how are you doing today? I will be giving you a quick discovery about myself. So, enjoy :)).  </p>

    <h2 style= "color:purple" > Me: 👩‍💻  </h2>
    <p> I was born on October 5th, 2004. When I was younger, I really loved playing games and jumpsies. I was the only weird kid in the family who was born with lots of cricket teeth. In my freetime, I love to watch dramas/animations, eat, listen to music&dance, practice my math skills (usually being forced to by sisters 😅.) I'm highly passionate about playing and working with computers especially when I get to design/decorate artifacts on a webpage. I am just naturally curious. </P>

    <h2 style= "color:blue"> Family:👨‍👧  </h2>
    <p> I have 3 older sisters, mommy, daddy, and a doggy (Kino). We all love eating, traveling, discovering the circular world, amusement,etc...My mom and dad love excersing especially at the beach absorbing the free fresh atmosphere, I also do, the three of us usually go and have a picnic over there. </p>

    <h2 style= "color:green"> Education: 🏫 </h2>
    <p> I came from Lindbergh Stem Academy and now I am a Sophomore at Polytechnic High School. After high school, I am extremely looking fordward to a good college such as Stanford or UCLA. Skeptically wanting to graduate with a Master Degree in Computer Science and that would have been a blast.
